# Advent_of_Code
Has all the adventures of advent of code from 2021 onwards

## 2021

First time doing Advent of Code properly, needed some more knowledge of NumPy and Scipy, plus hone my skills in Python.

Got 30 Stars to Day 15

## 2022

I decided let's try and do everything in C++ that year, was a slight mistake spent 60% of the time processing the input rather than attempting the challenge

Got 24 Stars to Day 12

## 2023

For 2023 I've decided to attempt a Python challenge where I want every day to finish under a second, that way if I manage to complete AoC 2023, it will be done in 25 seconds.

To do this I'm exploring the RAPIDS libraries (cuDF, cuML, cuGraph), CuPy and Numba which all have the capability of using GPUs.
